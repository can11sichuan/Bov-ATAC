# Bov-ATAC
## To get the ATAC-seq peak, we follow [Encode](https://www.encodeproject.org/data-standards/atac-seq/atac-encode4/)  
## To generate and annotate the peak we borrow the idea developed by [Meuleman](https://github.com/Altius/)  
## In eQTL analysis, we follow [GTEX](https://gtexportal.org/home/methods)  
## Enrichment analysis, we using [goshifter](https://github.com/immunogenomics/goshifter) developed by Trynka 
## Estimation of fa
By combining eQTL and ATAC-Seq, we estimate proportion of regulatory variants mapping to ATAC-Seq based on ML
